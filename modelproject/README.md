# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Solving the Malthus model** and is about population growth in an economy without technological growth.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb). Defined functions can be seen in the py-file [modelproject.py](modelproject.py)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project does not require any further installations.
